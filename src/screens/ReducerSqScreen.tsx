/*
1. SquareScreen App works right now - we could leave it as-is! But we could make it slightly better...
2. We have 3 separate pieces of useState
3. For SquareScreen app, these 3 piece of state are extremely related
4. There is a precise set of well-known ways in which we update these values
5. This makes 3 & 4 "state" a great candidate for being managed by a 'reducer'
6. What is 'Reducer'?? <== is actually a FunctionThatManagesChangesToAnObject
   1. Some fancy name
   2. Function that gets called with two objects
   3. Argument #1 ==> object that has all of out state in it
      (example: {red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0})
   4. Argument #2 ==> object that describes the update we want to make
      (example: {colorToChange: 'red', amount: 15})
   5. Look at Argument #2 and use it to decide how to change Argument #1
   6. important = Two technicalities
      - (1) We never change Argument #1 directly
      - (2) We must always return a value to be used as Argument #1
